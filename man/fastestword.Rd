  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chr}{Character vector.}

\item{outfile}{Path to a file that MeCab writes output.}

\item{encoding}{Encoding of tempfile that MeCab reads.}

\item{opt}{Options passed to mecab command.}

\item{...}{Any other arguments are passed to \code{base::writeLines()}.}
}
\value{
The function returns the value passed to `outfile` argument invisibly.
}
\description{
Calls mecab command directly via \code{base::system()}.
}
\details{
It is useful especially when just tokenizing loads of text.
Since `mecab -Owakati` command is specially-tuned,
it is generally faster that you directly call mecab command
than programmatically use mecab tagger
if you would like to just tokenize (wakachi-gaki) texts.
